Make this installable by as a PEAR package

I need to find out if one can have some configuration settings on the
host where we want to update the package, so they are filled in automatically
when running postinstall?

The following issues also has to be resolved:

1) Possibility for a custom menu - one should be able to modify the menu
2) Either standard css (packaged) but also possiblity for custom css rules
3) The directory should be customized
4) Possibility to use language files

When updating none of the customized stuff should be overridden - unless
it is no longer compatible with the package.

The question is whether I should make it two packages - one is
the mandatory package Webshop_Backend and then an optional package
Webshop_Frontend?

The correct is probably to do the following:

class Intraface_Webshop_Product {
  private $_credentials;
  function __construct($credentials) {
    $this->_credentials = $credentials;
  }
  function get($product_id) {}
  function getList() {}

}

class Intraface_Webshop_Basket {
  private $_credentials;
  function __construct($credentials) {
    $this->_credentials = $credentials;
  }
  function add($product_id) {}
  function change($procuct_id, $quantity) {}
}

class Intraface_Webshop_OnlinePayment {
  private $_credentials;
  function __construct($credentials) {
    $this->_credentials = $credentials;
  }
  function addPayment() {}
}

class Intraface_Webshop_Frontend {
  private $_template_engine;

  /**
   * The template engine must have the following interface:
   * interface TemplateEngine {
   *   function assign($variable, $value);
   *   function display($template);
   * }
   * @param object $template_engine
   */
  function __construct($template_engine) {
    $this->_template_engine = $template_engine;
  }

}
